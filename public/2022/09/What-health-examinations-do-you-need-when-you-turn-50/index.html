        <h1 id="What-health-examinations-do-you-need-when-you-turn-50"><a href="#What-health-examinations-do-you-need-when-you-turn-50" class="headerlink" title="What health examinations do you need when you turn 50?"></a>What health examinations do you need when you turn 50?</h1><p>When you reach the ripe age of 50, there are a few health examinations that you will need to undergo in order to keep on top of your health. These exams will help to screen for any health concerns that you may have as you age, and can help to catch any potential problems early on so that they can be treated.</p>
<p>The first exam that you will need to have when you turn 50 is a blood pressure check. High blood pressure can be a sign of cardiovascular disease, so it is important to get it checked regularly. You will also need a cholesterol screening at this time, as high cholesterol can also lead to heart problems.</p>
<p>You should also have a routine mammogram and Pap smear done at least once every two years. Both of these exams can help to screen for cancer, so it is important to make sure that you get them done regularly. Additionally, men over the age of 50 should have a prostate cancer screening done as well.</p>
<p>Other exams that you may need to have when you turn 50 include an eye exam, a hearing test, and a bone density test. All of these exams can help to assess your overall health and identify any potential problems that you may have. By getting these exams done regularly, you can ensure that you are keeping your health in the best possible shape.</p>
<h1 id="What-health-examinations-do-you-need-when-you-turn-60"><a href="#What-health-examinations-do-you-need-when-you-turn-60" class="headerlink" title="What health examinations do you need when you turn 60?"></a>What health examinations do you need when you turn 60?</h1><p>When you turn 60, you may need to start thinking about health screenings and examinations that you will need to keep you healthy as you age. This includes screenings for conditions like breast cancer, prostate cancer, and heart disease.</p>
<p>One important health examination that all adults should have is a colonoscopy. A colonoscopy can help detect early signs of colorectal cancer, which is the third most common type of cancer in the United States.</p>
<p>You may also need other screenings for different types of cancer depending on your risk factors. For example, women over 60 should have mammograms every year to screen for breast cancer. And men over 60 should have regular prostate exams to screen for prostate cancer.</p>
<p>Other health screenings that are recommended for people over 60 include blood pressure and cholesterol checks, glaucoma tests, and skin exams.</p>
<p>It’s important to talk with your doctor about what health screenings are right for you based on your age, health history, and other factors. Screenings can help detect health problems early on so that they can be treated before they become more serious.</p>
<h1 id="What-health-examinations-do-you-need-when-you-turn-70"><a href="#What-health-examinations-do-you-need-when-you-turn-70" class="headerlink" title="What health examinations do you need when you turn 70?"></a>What health examinations do you need when you turn 70?</h1><p>For people turning 70, there are a number of health examinations that are recommended in order to maintain good health. Some of these exams may include a physical exam, blood pressure check, cholesterol check, diabetes test and more.</p>
<p>A physical exam is important for all adults, and even more so for those over the age of 70. This exam can help your doctor detect any potential health problems that you may have. It’s also important to get your blood pressure checked regularly as high blood pressure can lead to many health problems down the road.</p>
<p>It’s also important to get your cholesterol levels checked. High cholesterol levels can increase your risk for heart disease and other health problems. If you have diabetes, it’s important to get it checked regularly as well. Diabetes can lead to serious health problems if not treated properly.</p>
<p>These are just a few examples of the health examinations that are recommended for people turning 70. It’s important to talk to your doctor about what exams are right for you. By following these guidelines, you can help ensure that you stay healthy and enjoy a long life!</p>
<h1 id="What-health-examinations-do-you-need-every-year"><a href="#What-health-examinations-do-you-need-every-year" class="headerlink" title="What health examinations do you need every year?"></a>What health examinations do you need every year?</h1><p>A lot of people don’t know what health examinations they need every year. This is because health examination guidelines can vary depending on your age, medical history, and other individual factors. However, there are certain health examinations that are generally recommended for everyone.</p>
<p>The most common health examinations include a blood pressure check, cholesterol screening, and a screening for diabetes. Many experts also recommend getting screened for colon cancer and breast cancer regularly. You may also need additional screenings depending on your age and medical history.</p>
<p>If you’re not sure which health examinations you need, speak to your doctor. They can help you create a personalized health examination plan that meets your specific needs.</p>
<h1 id="What-health-examinations-do-you-need-if-you-are-pregnant"><a href="#What-health-examinations-do-you-need-if-you-are-pregnant" class="headerlink" title="What health examinations do you need if you are pregnant?"></a>What health examinations do you need if you are pregnant?</h1><p>If you are pregnant, you will need to have a series of health examinations to ensure a healthy pregnancy and baby. The type and frequency of these exams may vary depending on your health history, age, and other risk factors.</p>
<p>The following are some of the most common health examinations recommended for pregnant women:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Obstetrician check-up: This is a series of examinations and tests conducted by an obstetrician (a doctor who specializes in caring for pregnant women and delivering babies). The obstetrician will check your overall health, look for any signs of problems, and make sure your baby is developing normally. You will also likely have lab tests, an ultrasound scan, and a pelvic exam as part of this visit.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Maternal serum screening: This test measures the amount of certain substances in your blood. It can help identify whether your baby is at risk for certain birth defects, such as Down syndrome. It is usually performed between weeks 16 and 18 of pregnancy.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Glucose screening: This test screens for gestational diabetes, a type of diabetes that develops during pregnancy. It is usually done around 24 weeks pregnant.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Group B strep testing: This test checks for group B strep bacteria in the vagina. If the bacteria are present, you will be given antibiotics during labor to prevent infection in your baby. The test is typically done between 35 and 37 weeks pregnant.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cholesterol screening: This test screens for high cholesterol levels, which can increase the risk of heart disease later in life. It is typically done during the third trimester of pregnancy.</p>
</li>
</ol>
