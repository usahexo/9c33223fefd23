        <h1 id="New-York-Jets-First-in-Line-for-NFL-Playoff-Slot"><a href="#New-York-Jets-First-in-Line-for-NFL-Playoff-Slot" class="headerlink" title="New York Jets First in Line for NFL Playoff Slot"></a>New York Jets First in Line for NFL Playoff Slot</h1><p>The New York Jets are in the driver’s seat for the NFL playoffs. With a record of 7-5, they are currently in first place in the AFC East division. The Jets have four games remaining in the regular season, and they will be looking to extend their winning streak to four games.</p>
<p>The Jets’ upcoming opponents all have losing records. They will be facing off against the Oakland Raiders (3-9), the Green Bay Packers (4-7-1), the Miami Dolphins (5-6), and the Buffalo Bills (4-8). If they can win all four of these games, they will clinch a playoff berth.</p>
<p>Although it is still possible for other teams to overtake them, the Jets currently have a two-game lead over their closest competitors. As long as they don’t lose any more ground, they should be able to hold on to their first place position.</p>
<p>This would be a major accomplishment for the Jets, who have had a rollercoaster season so far. They started out with a five-game winning streak, but then went on to lose four consecutive games. They have since recovered and are now on a winning streak.</p>
<p>If they make it into the playoffs, the Jets will be looking to make an impact. In order to do this, they will need to improve their offense. Currently, they rank near the bottom of the league in terms of points scored.</p>
<p>If they can improve their offensive performance in the playoffs, they could potentially make it all the way to the Super Bowl. This would be a remarkable achievement for such a young team.</p>
<h1 id="Green-and-White-a-Force-in-NFL-as-Jets-Deal-First-in-Black-Jack"><a href="#Green-and-White-a-Force-in-NFL-as-Jets-Deal-First-in-Black-Jack" class="headerlink" title="Green and White a Force in NFL as Jets Deal First in Black Jack"></a>Green and White a Force in NFL as Jets Deal First in Black Jack</h1><p>It’s tough to be a Jets fan. The team has not had a winning season since 2010 and have only made the playoffs four times in their history. As much as this stinks for Jets fans, it means opportunity for other teams in the league.</p>
<p>In the NFL, there is parity. This means that every team has a chance to win on any given Sunday (or Monday, or Thursday). The Jets are a good example of this parity. Despite their struggles over the past few seasons, they have some very talented players on their roster. This was on full display in the 2018 NFL Draft.</p>
<p>The Jets traded up to the third overall pick and selected Sam Darnold, quarterback out of USC. Darnold is a prototypical quarterback who has all of the physical tools to be successful in the NFL. He has an excellent arm and good size at 6’4” and 220 pounds.</p>
<p>Darnold also has impressive intangibles. He is a hard worker who is coachable and takes instruction well. He also possesses excellent leadership skills and is unselfish with the ball. These traits will serve him well as he transitions to the NFL level.</p>
<p>The Jets also addressed their need for pass rush with their first pick in round two, selecting Lorenzo Carter out of Georgia. Carter is a freak athlete who possesses excellent speed and athleticism. He is also very strong, which allows him to play with good leverage against offensive linemen.</p>
<p>Carter will be an asset to the Jets defense as a pass rusher off of the edge. He has the potential to be one of the best players in this year’s draft class and should make an immediate impact for New York.</p>
<p>The Jets also added some depth to their offense in rounds three and four, selecting running back Isaiah Crowell out of Alabama State and Quincy Enunwa out of Nebraska respectively. Crowell is a bruising runner who will add toughness to New York’s running game. He averaged 4 yards per carry during his four-year college career and can contribute in both the rushing and passing games.</p>
<p>Enunwa is an interesting addition to the Jets offense. At 6’2” and 225 pounds, he is a big receiver who can make contested catches in traffic. He also has good speed and ran a 4.45 40-yard dash at his pro day. Enunwa missed all of last season with a neck injury but is healthy now and should compete for playing time opposite Robby Anderson this year..</p>
<p>The Jets had an excellent draft overall, adding three potential starters on offense and defense. They still have some holes to fill, especially at wide receiver and linebacker, but they have improved significantly from where they were last season.</p>
<h1 id="New-York-Jets-Soar-to-Top-of-AFC-East-with-Early-Black-Jack-Win"><a href="#New-York-Jets-Soar-to-Top-of-AFC-East-with-Early-Black-Jack-Win" class="headerlink" title="New York Jets Soar to Top of AFC East with Early Black Jack Win"></a>New York Jets Soar to Top of AFC East with Early Black Jack Win</h1><p>The New York Jets started their season with a bang on Sunday, September 10, when they soundly defeated the Oakland Raiders, who were widely considered one of the top teams in the AFC. The Jets played a smart game, taking an early lead and never relinquishing it.</p>
<p>This is a very promising start for the Jets, who now find themselves at the top of the AFC East. Theearly win gives them much-needed momentum as they head into their next few games.</p>
<p>The Jets have long been considered one of the best teams in the NFL, but they have always seemed to come up short when it matters most. This year,<a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://choegocasino.com/">카지노 사이트</a> however, things seem to be different. With a new head coach and plenty of talented players on their roster, the Jets are poised for big things.</p>
<p>If they can continue to play well and stay focused, there is no doubt that they will make it deep into the playoffs. This is an exciting time to be a fan of the New York Jets!</p>
<h1 id="AFC-East-Goes-to-the-Jets-–-Again"><a href="#AFC-East-Goes-to-the-Jets-–-Again" class="headerlink" title="AFC East Goes to the Jets – Again!"></a>AFC East Goes to the Jets – Again!</h1><p>The AFC East was won by the Jets for the second year in a row. This division is always up for grabs, and it’s never a sure thing which team will come out on top. The Jets proved that they are a force to be reckoned with, and they will be a tough opponent for any team in the playoffs.</p>
<p>The Patriots had a strong season, but they were not able to overcome the Jets. The Bills and Dolphins both had disappointing seasons, and they were unable to make much of an impact in the divisional race.</p>
<p>The Jets had a dominant season, and they showed that they are one of the best teams in the league. They have a talented roster, and they are poised for success in the playoffs.</p>
<h1 id="Buffalo-Bills-Miami-Dolphins-Left-in-the-Dust-as-New-York-Jets-Deal-First-in-Black-Jack"><a href="#Buffalo-Bills-Miami-Dolphins-Left-in-the-Dust-as-New-York-Jets-Deal-First-in-Black-Jack" class="headerlink" title="Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins Left in the Dust as New York Jets Deal First in Black Jack"></a>Buffalo Bills, Miami Dolphins Left in the Dust as New York Jets Deal First in Black Jack</h1><p>The New York Jets took the opportunity to deal with one of their NFC East rivals on Thursday night. They sent the Buffalo Bills and Miami Dolphins scrambling as they traded up to the #3 overall pick in the NFL Draft.</p>
<p>This move allows the Jets to take their pick of one of the top quarterbacks in this year’s draft class. The Bills and Dolphins will now have to battle it out for the other top quarterback prospects.</p>
<p>Both Josh Allen and Baker Mayfield are now in play for the two teams. The Bills were widely expected to take Allen at #7 overall, but now they may have to trade up if they want him. The Dolphins were mocked to take Mayfield at #11 overall, but they may have to trade up to get him as well.</p>
<p>The Jets gave up three second-round picks (No. 53, 56, and 65) in order to jump ahead of their rivals. This is a big move for new general manager Mike Maccagnan, who is looking to rebuild the team after a 5-11 season last year.</p>
<p>The Jets now have plenty of ammunition to move around in the draft later on tonight. They could use those picks to move back up into the first round or try and acquire more picks for next year’s draft.</p>
