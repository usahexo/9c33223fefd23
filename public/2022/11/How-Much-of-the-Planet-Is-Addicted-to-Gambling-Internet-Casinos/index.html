        <h1 id="How-Much-of-the-Planet-Is-Addicted-to-Gambling-Internet-Casinos"><a href="#How-Much-of-the-Planet-Is-Addicted-to-Gambling-Internet-Casinos" class="headerlink" title="How Much of the Planet Is Addicted to Gambling Internet Casinos?"></a>How Much of the Planet Is Addicted to Gambling Internet Casinos?</h1><p>The gambling industry is one that is revered by some and reviled by others. Though it has been around for centuries in different forms, the advent of the internet has allowed gambling to reach new heights. Today, there are thousands of gambling websites available, and people from all corners of the globe can partake in this activity.</p>
<p>But just how popular is online gambling? And how does this popularity compare to other forms of gambling?</p>
<p>To get an idea, let’s take a look at some statistics.</p>
<p>In 2015, it was estimated that the global online gambling market was worth $44 billion . This figure is expected to grow to $80 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>In comparison, the global casino market is worth $55 billion . This means that online gambling is already more popular than traditional casino gambling.</p>
<p>When it comes to individual countries, the United States has the largest online gambling market . It is worth $14.8 billion , which accounts for 34% of the global market. The UK comes in second with a market value of $10.7 billion .</p>
<p>Gambling is not only popular among adults; it is also popular among children and teenagers. In fact, a study conducted in 2016 found that nearly 1 in 3 teenagers had gambled online in the previous month. This number is likely to increase as online gambling becomes more popular.</p>
<p>So why is online gambling so popular? There are many reasons, but some of the main reasons include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Convenience: Online gambling can be done from anywhere in the world, at any time of day or night. This flexibility is one of the main reasons why it has become so popular.</li>
<li>Variety: Online casinos offer a much greater variety of games than traditional casinos do. This allows players to find games that appeal to them and that they enjoy playing.</li>
<li>Rewards: Many online casinos offer rewards such as bonuses, free spins, and loyalty points to their players. This incentive system encourages players to continue playing and makes them feel appreciated by the casino.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="85-of-World’s-Population-Gamble-at-Least-Once-a-Year"><a href="#85-of-World’s-Population-Gamble-at-Least-Once-a-Year" class="headerlink" title="85% of World’s Population Gamble at Least Once a Year"></a>85% of World’s Population Gamble at Least Once a Year</h1><p>Gambling is one of the most popular activities in the world, enjoyed by millions of people from all walks of life. A recent study has found that 85% of the world’s population gambles at least once a year, with most doing so for recreation and entertainment.</p>
<p>While gambling can be fun and exciting, it can also be addictive and harmful. Some people lose a lot of money while gambling, while others end up in debt or even suffer financial ruin. Gambling can also have negative consequences for families and relationships.</p>
<p>Despite these risks, many people continue to gamble, often risking more than they can afford to lose. If you’re thinking about gambling, it’s important to be aware of the risks involved and only gamble what you can afford to lose.</p>
<h1 id="The-Average-Person-Spends-6-a-Month-on-Gambling"><a href="#The-Average-Person-Spends-6-a-Month-on-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="The Average Person Spends $6 a Month on Gambling"></a>The Average Person Spends $6 a Month on Gambling</h1><p>The average American adult spends about $6 per month on gambling activities, according to a recent study from the University of Las Vegas. This may seem like a small amount, but when totaled up over the course of a year, that’s nearly $75 per person.</p>
<p>And while most people think of casinos when they think of gambling, the truth is that there are many other ways to lose money in this way. Gambling can include activities like playing the lottery or betting on sports games.</p>
<p>It’s not just adults who are spending money on gambling either – adolescents are also wagering significant sums. A report from the National Council on Problem Gambling (NCPG) finds that 11% of high school students have gambled in the past year, and that they’ve collectively spent more than $2.5 billion dollars on gamblingrelated activities.</p>
<p>That may not seem like a lot of money in comparison to the $6 billion that adults spend each year, but when you consider how much money 16- and 17-year-olds have access to, it’s a troubling statistic. Especially since adolescents are more likely to engage in risk behaviors like gambling and drinking alcohol than their older counterparts.</p>
<p>So why do people gamble? There are many reasons, but one of the main ones is that people believe they can win big. And when they do lose, they often end up in debt. In fact, according to the NCPG report referenced earlier, almost half (45%) of problem gamblers had debt problems because of their gambling losses.</p>
<p>There are other risks associated with gambling as well. For example, people can become addicted to it, which can lead to all sorts of other problems in their lives. Additionally, compulsive gamblers are more likely to experience mental health issues like depression and anxiety.</p>
<p>So what can be done to address this issue? One thing is for sure – something has to be done soon. The NCPG report found that rates of problem gambling are increasing each year, and if nothing is done then it will only continue to get worse.</p>

<p>The research, published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal, is the first to provide a global overview of the economic cost of problem gambling.</p>
<p>It found that gambling addiction leads to significant losses in productivity as well as increased health and social care costs.</p>
<p>In Europe, for example, the cost of gambling addiction is estimated at £17 billion (€19 billion) a year, while in North America it is estimated at $47 billion (€40 billion).</p>
<p>The study also found that problem gamblers are more likely to have mental health problems and be unemployed or homeless. In some cases, they turn to crime in order to finance their addiction.</p>
<p>Lead author Dr Andres Fonseca from the University of Las Palmas de Gran Canaria in Spain said: “This study confirms what we have long suspected - that problem gambling is a serious issue with far-reaching consequences for individuals, families and society as a whole.”</p>
<p>He added: “To date, there has been very little research on the economic impact of problem gambling and this study provides much-needed evidence on the scale of the problem worldwide.”</p>
<p>So far, there has been very little research on the economic impact of problem gambling and this study provides much-needed evidence on the scale of the problem worldwide.</p>
<h1 id="One-in-Five-Gambling-addicts-Attempt-Suicide"><a href="#One-in-Five-Gambling-addicts-Attempt-Suicide" class="headerlink" title="One in Five Gambling addicts Attempt Suicide"></a>One in Five Gambling addicts Attempt Suicide</h1><p>Gambling addiction is a serious mental health disorder that affects millions of people in the United States. New research shows that one in five gambling addicts attempt suicide.</p>
<p>The study, which was published in the journal <i>Addiction,</i> looked at data from more than 21,000 people who had a gambling problem. The researchers found that 20 percent of those people had attempted suicide at some point in their lives.</p>
<p>“This study provides evidence that gambling addiction is a serious public health problem,” said study author Dr. Margarita Alegría. “It is important to raise awareness about the risks of suicide among people with gambling problems and to provide them with appropriate treatment.”</p>
<p>Gambling addiction can have a devastating effect on individuals and families. The disorder can lead to financial ruin, job loss, relationship problems, and even suicide.</p>
<p>If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, it is important to get help. There are many treatments available for gambling addiction, including counseling and medication.</p>
