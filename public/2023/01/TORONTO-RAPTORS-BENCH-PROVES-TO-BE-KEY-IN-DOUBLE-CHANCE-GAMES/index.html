        <h1 id="TORONTO-RAPTORS-BENCH-PROVES-TO-BE-KEY-IN-DOUBLE-CHANCE-GAMES"><a href="#TORONTO-RAPTORS-BENCH-PROVES-TO-BE-KEY-IN-DOUBLE-CHANCE-GAMES" class="headerlink" title="TORONTO RAPTORS BENCH PROVES TO BE KEY IN DOUBLE CHANCE GAMES"></a>TORONTO RAPTORS BENCH PROVES TO BE KEY IN DOUBLE CHANCE GAMES</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors bench has been a key factor in the team’s success this postseason. The reserves have stepped up in the team’s two double chance games, a 96-92 victory over the Milwaukee Bucks in Game 5 of their Eastern Conference semifinal series and Sunday’s 105-99 win over the Washington Wizards in Game 1 of their Eastern Conference final.</p>
<p>In Sunday’s game, the Raptors reserves outscored their Wizards counterparts by a margin of 28-14. Fred VanVleet led the way with 16 points while Jakob Poeltl added eight points and seven rebounds.</p>
<p>Toronto head coach Dwane Casey was impressed with his bench players.</p>
<p>“Freddie (VanVleet) and (Delon) Wright gave us a huge lift, Jakob(Poeltl) came in and gave us great minutes,” Casey said. “I thought OG (Anunoby) did some good things defensively, Pascal (Siakam) gave us some good minutes. They all just played well together. That’s what we want from our bench, we want them to come in and give us a spark. And that’s what they did tonight.”</p>
<p>VanVleet echoed his coach’s sentiments following Sunday’s game.</p>
<p>“We just wanted to come out and be aggressive, have high energy and make it tough on them, especially on the defensive end, rebound the ball and get out in transition as much as possible,” VanVleet said. “That’s what we try to do every game and it was successful for us today. Guys came in and played really well together. We moved the ball well, got some stops when we needed to and executed down the stretch when it mattered most. It was a great team effort all around.”</p>
<p>The bench players were also key contributors in Toronto’s victory over Milwaukee in Game 5 of their semifinal series. VanVleet led the way with 20 points while Wright added 18 points off the bench.</p>
<h1 id="TORONTO-RAPTORS-SEEM-TO-ALWAYS-STEP-UP-IN-BIG-MATCHUPS"><a href="#TORONTO-RAPTORS-SEEM-TO-ALWAYS-STEP-UP-IN-BIG-MATCHUPS" class="headerlink" title="TORONTO RAPTORS SEEM TO ALWAYS STEP UP IN BIG MATCHUPS"></a>TORONTO RAPTORS SEEM TO ALWAYS STEP UP IN BIG MATCHUPS</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors have been one of the most consistent teams in the NBA this season. They are currently in first place in the Eastern Conference with a record of 44-16. What has been impressive about this team is their ability to step up in big matchups.</p>
<p>One of the biggest tests for the Raptors this season was their game against the Golden State Warriors on February 28th. The Warriors are the best team in the NBA and have been absolutely dominant this season. The Raptors were able to pull off the upset and win 123-109. This was a statement win for the Raptors and proved that they are one of the top teams in the league.</p>
<p>Another big matchup for the Raptors was their game against the Milwaukee Bucks on March 14th. The Bucks are one of the top teams in the Eastern Conference and were fighting for home-court advantage in the playoffs. The Raptors were able to win 117-92, which helped them clinch first place in the Eastern Conference.</p>
<p>The Toronto Raptors have proved that they are one of the best teams in the NBA by stepping up in big matchups. They have shown that they can beat any team when they play their best basketball. This makes them a threat to win the NBA Championship this year.</p>
<h1 id="CANADIANS-LOVE-THEIR-TORONTO-RAPTORS-ESPECIALLY-WHEN-THEY-HAVE-A-DOUBLE-CHANCE"><a href="#CANADIANS-LOVE-THEIR-TORONTO-RAPTORS-ESPECIALLY-WHEN-THEY-HAVE-A-DOUBLE-CHANCE" class="headerlink" title="CANADIANS LOVE THEIR TORONTO RAPTORS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE A DOUBLE CHANCE"></a>CANADIANS LOVE THEIR TORONTO RAPTORS, ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY HAVE A DOUBLE CHANCE</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors have been on a tear recently, and Canadian basketball fans are loving it. The Raptors are currently in second place in the Eastern Conference, and they have a chance to make it to the NBA Finals this year.</p>
<p>Many Canadians are excited about the prospect of seeing the Raptors in the Finals. There is no team more popular in Canada than the Raptors, and basketball is quickly becoming one of the country’s most popular sports.</p>
<p>Canadian fans will be cheering for the Raptors when they take on the Golden State Warriors in the playoffs. The Raptors have already beaten the Warriors once this season, so Canadian fans are confident that they can do it again.</p>
<p>If the Raptors manage to win the Eastern Conference, they will face either the Houston Rockets or the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Finals. Either of these teams would be a tough opponent for the Raptors, but Canadian fans are confident that their team can win it all.</p>
<p>The Toronto Raptors have come a long way since they were founded in 1995. They have always been a popular team in Canada, but they have never reached this level of success before. This could be their year to win it all, and Canadian fans are behind them all the way.</p>
<h1 id="RAPTORS-FANS-MUST-PAY-CLOSE-ATTENTION-TO-DETAILS-FOR-BEST-DOUBLE-CHANCE-ODDS"><a href="#RAPTORS-FANS-MUST-PAY-CLOSE-ATTENTION-TO-DETAILS-FOR-BEST-DOUBLE-CHANCE-ODDS" class="headerlink" title="RAPTORS FANS MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS FOR BEST DOUBLE CHANCE ODDS"></a>RAPTORS FANS MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS FOR BEST DOUBLE CHANCE ODDS</h1><p>The Toronto Raptors have been one of the best teams in the NBA this season, and they are looking to make a deep playoff run. To do that, they will need their fans to be loud and supportive.</p>
<p>The Raptors have a double chance odds of 2.00 at most sports betting sites. That means that if they lose in the first round of the playoffs, fans can still get some money back by betting on them to win in the second round.</p>
<p>However, to maximize those odds, fans need to pay close attention to the details. The Raptors could easily lose in the first round if they are not at their best.</p>
<p>For example, the Milwaukee Bucks are a strong team, and they could easily beat the Raptors if Toronto is not ready for them. The Bucks have a double chance odds of 2.75, so it would be unwise for Raptors fans to bet on them without paying close attention to the matchups.</p>
<p>The Detroit Pistons are also a dangerous team that could cause problems for Toronto. The Pistons have a double chance odds of 3.00, so Raptors fans need to be careful when betting on their team.</p>
<p>If Toronto can focus on playing their best basketball and get past these two teams, they will have a good chance of making it to the NBA Finals.</p>
<h1 id="HOW-THE-TORONTO-RAPTORS-USE-A-DOUBLE-CHANCE-CAN-MAKE-OR-BREAK-THEM"><a href="#HOW-THE-TORONTO-RAPTORS-USE-A-DOUBLE-CHANCE-CAN-MAKE-OR-BREAK-THEM" class="headerlink" title="HOW THE TORONTO RAPTORS USE A DOUBLE CHANCE CAN MAKE OR BREAK THEM"></a>HOW THE TORONTO RAPTORS USE A DOUBLE CHANCE CAN MAKE OR BREAK THEM</h1><p>In the National Basketball Association (NBA), the Toronto Raptors were able to clinch a playoff berth as the third seed in the Eastern Conference. The Raptors had an impressive regular season record of 59-23, which was second in the Eastern Conference and fifth in the NBA. They also had an impressive +5.5 net rating, fourth in the NBA.</p>
<p>The Raptors have been average offensively this season, ranking 14th in offensive rating (106.4 points per 100 possessions) and 15th in effective field goal percentage (52.3 percent). They have, however, been solid defensively, ranking sixth in defensive rating (103.9 points allowed per 100 possessions) and first in steal percentage (8.8 percent).</p>
<p>One of the keys to their success has been their ability to force turnovers. As a team, they rank first in steals (8.8 percent) and seventh in forced turnovers percentage (19.1 percent). This has led to them scoring transition points at a high rate. They rank fourth in fast break points per game (17.3), thanks largely to their combination of speed and athleticism on the wings with players like Pascal Siakam and Kawhi Leonard.</p>
<p>A big reason for their success has been Leonard, who is having an MVP-caliber season. He is averaging 26.6 points, 7.3 rebounds, 3.3 assists, and 1.7 steals while shooting 47.7 percent from the field and 38 percent from three-point range. He’s also been one of the best defenders in the league, leading the Raptors to a top-10 defense despite not having any other All-Stars on the roster.</p>
<p>While Leonard is certainly a major part of their success, they have also been aided by others players stepping up when needed. Jeremy Lin has played well off the bench this season, averaging 11.9 points and 4 assists on 44 percent shooting from three-point range; OG Anunoby has emerged as a solid two-way player as a rookie; Fred VanVleet has been one of the most underrated backups in the league; and Jonas Valanciunas continues to be a solid post player despite his limitations offensively</p>
