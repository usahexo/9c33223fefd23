#  New Jersey's rollover sports betting is a huge success!

According to the recent news, New Jersey's rollover sports betting is doing great. The state has seen a huge increase in the amount of money wagered on sports, with over $318 million wagered in the first six months of 2018. This is compared to the $314 million wagered in all of 2017.

This is great news for the state and its economy, as it creates new jobs and generates revenue. It is also good news for casino operators such as Caesars Entertainment Corp., which have seen their share prices increase as a result of the surge in betting activity.

Sports betting has always been a popular pastime in New Jersey, and this new rollover system has made it even more popular. With easy access to online and mobile betting, people can now bet on sports anytime, anywhere. This has led to increased interest in sporting events, and more people are now tuning into games to see how their bets are doing.

The success of New Jersey's rollover sports betting could lead other states to follow suit. This would be good news for the gaming industry, as it would create even more jobs and generate more revenue. So far, only Nevada and Delaware have legalized full-scale sports betting, but others could soon follow suit.

If you're looking for a fun and exciting way to gamble on sports, then New Jersey's rollover system is definitely worth checking out!

#  Nevada sees a decline in revenue since rollover sports betting was legalized

Las Vegas, NV - The legalization of sports betting in Nevada last year was supposed to bring in an influx of revenue to the state. However, a recent report from the Nevada Gaming Control Board shows that this has not been the case. Total gaming revenue for the state was down 2.7% in the fiscal year that ended in June, compared to the previous fiscal year. This decline is attributed largely to lower gambling winnings from sports betting.

The rollover sports betting law, which allows bettors to keep their winnings from one game over to the next, was enacted in 2015. However, it seems that this has not led to more people gambling on sports. In fact, according to the Control Board's report, the average amount wagered per person on sports contests decreased by almost 8%.

While some argue that the rollover sports betting law has been a failure, others believe that it has simply taken time for people to learn about and take advantage of it. "It's still early," said Michael Lawton, senior research analyst with the Control Board. "I'm not willing at this point to say it's a failed policy."

Others are not so sure. "It's been over a year since they passed that awful law and nothing's changed," said casino owner Sheldon Adelson. "It's just lining the pockets of these offshore companies."

Regardless of whether or not the rollover sports betting law is working as intended, it is clear that Nevada is seeing a decline in revenue overall. This could mean trouble for the state's economy and its residents alike.

#  Delaware announces they will also be offering rollover sports betting

Delaware became the latest state to announce they will be offering rollover sports betting. This means that bettors can keep placing bets on games even after they have already been played. The state also announced that they will be partnering with William Hill to offer the service.

This move comes as other states are also beginning to offer sports betting. In Pennsylvania, for example, the first sportsbook recently opened at the Parx Casino. Other states, including New Jersey, are also in the process of launching their own sportsbooks.

Delaware is hoping that the rollover betting option will help them to attract more bettors. So far, the response seems to be positive, with many people commenting on social media that they are looking forward to using the service.

The rollover option is not available in all states, so it is important to check the laws in your state before placing any bets. In Delaware, bettors can place a wager on any game that has already taken place within the past seven days. The odds for these bets will be based on how much money was wagered on the original game.

There is no limit on how much money can be won through rollover betting, and payouts will be sent directly to players’ bank accounts or credited to their accounts at Delaware’s three casinos. Bettors can also choose to place a wager through one of William Hill’s retail locations.

#  Illinois and New York are considering legalizing rollover sports betting

The legalization of sports betting in Illinois and New York is being considered as a way to generate additional revenue for the states.

In Illinois, the legalization of sports betting would be part of a larger package of gaming reforms that would also include online gambling and video gaming terminals at racetracks and casinos. The state is looking to generate an additional $200 million in revenue from gambling.

In New York, the state legislature is considering a bill that would legalize sports betting, including mobile betting. The state is looking to generate an additional $100 million in revenue from sports betting.

These proposals come as several other states have moved to legalize or expand sports betting in light of last year’s repeal of the federal ban on sports betting.

Illinois and New York are among the largest states in the country, so legalizing sports betting there could have a significant impact on the overall market for legal sports betting.

#  Maryland becomes the latest state to legalize rollover sports betting

Maryland lawmakers on Monday voted to legalize rollover sports betting, making the state the latest in the nation to allow bettors to carry over their wagers from one day to the next.

The bill, HB 989, now heads to Gov. Larry Hogan (R) for his signature. Hogan has not said whether he will sign the bill into law, but he is generally supportive of gambling expansion measures.

Under HB 989, bettors would be able to roll over their sports bets from one day to the next, provided that they do not exceed their original wager by more than 10%. The bill would also limit the amount of money that can be wagered on any single game or event to $2,000.

“This common-sense legislation will protect consumers and provide a level playing field for our state’s casinos and horse racing tracks, while also generating new revenue for education and other important priorities,” said Del. Eric Luedtke (D), the bill’s sponsor.

If signed into law, Maryland would join Delaware, New Jersey, and West Virginia as states that allow rollover sports betting. Nevada is the only state that does not permit bettors to carry over their wagers from one day to the next.
