#  Which two states have not legalized some form of gambling?

While gambling is legal in most U.S. states, there are two exceptions: Utah and Hawaii. Both states have a form of legalized gambling, but it is limited to certain types of games or entertainment venues. For example, Utah has a state-run lottery, while Hawaii allows betting on horse races.

There are several explanations for why these two states have not legalized more widespread gambling. In Utah, the predominant religion is Mormonism, which teaches that gambling is a sin. In Hawaii, there may be concerns about the potential social costs of gambling addiction.

Despite not legalizing most forms of gambling, both Utah and Hawaii have seen an increase in gaming revenue in recent years. This may be due to tourists visiting from other states where gambling is legal.

#  Which two states don't permit online casino gambling?

There are a total of forty-eight states that permit some form of online casino gambling, while the remaining two, Utah and Hawaii, do not permit any form of online casino gambling. The primary reason why these states have chosen to prohibit online casino gambling is due to the concerns over potential addiction and gambling-related problems.

# What is the history of gambling in the United States?

Gambling in the United States began shortly after the nation's founding with lotteries used to finance the military and other government initiatives. After the Civil War, gambling spread westward as prospectors and settlers sought their fortunes. Gambling was popular on the frontier, where there were few laws and even fewer authorities to enforce them. By the early 20th century, most states had legalized some form of gambling. In 1931, Congress passed the Federal Wire Act, which prohibited interstate wagering on sports, and in 1951, it passed the Las Vegas Gaming Control Act, which regulated casinos on the Strip. The late 1960s saw a wave of anti-gambling sentiment led by then-governor Ronald Reagan of California. This led to a number of state bans and a federal crackdown on offshore betting. In 1987, New Jersey became the first state to legalize casino gaming in Atlantic City.

The spread of casino gambling throughout the country has been accompanied by controversy and debate about its social and economic effects. Advocates argue that gambling is a harmless diversion that generates tax revenue and jobs, while opponents claim that it exploits poor people, leads to crime and disorder, and creates social problems.
