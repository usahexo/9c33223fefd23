#  How Much Money to Spend in Las Vegas Without Gambling?

Las Vegas is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world. People from all over the globe come to Sin City to enjoy the amazing nightlife, casinos, and restaurants. However, for some people, gambling is not their thing. They would much rather enjoy other activities Las Vegas has to offer without risking any money. So, the question is: how much money should you bring to Las Vegas if you're not going to gamble?

Well, that depends on what you want to do in Vegas. If you're just looking to explore the city and hang out at the casino hotels, then $500 should be more than enough. However, if you plan on doing some sightseeing or going on excursions, then you'll probably need closer to $1,000. Just remember that Las Vegas is an expensive city, so make sure you have enough money to cover your costs.

Another thing to keep in mind is that many of the activities in Las Vegas are not cheap. For example, a trip down the famous Las Vegas Strip can cost anywhere from $15 to $30 per person. And if you want to take a ride on the High Roller Ferris wheel, that will set you back another $25 per person. So, if you're planning on doing a lot of things while in Vegas, make sure you have enough money saved up.

In short, if you're not planning on gambling in Las Vegas, then bring around $1,000 with you to make sure you have plenty of spending money. That should be more than enough for most people. Just be mindful of the high costs associated with traveling in this city and try not to go overboard with your spending. Have fun!
