Valley of Pharaohs is a valley in the south-west of the city of Luxor in Egypt. It was the main burial ground for the rulers of the New Kingdom from 1539 BC to 1075 BC.

The area contains more than 1,000 tombs and graveyards, including some of Egypt's most impressive pharaonic tombs from the 18th to 20th dynasties. The valley was used as a place of burial for Amenhotep III, Akhenaten, Tutankhamun, Siptah, Tausret, Seti I and Ramesses III.

Most of the tombs were cut into the limestone rockface, and many are lined with painted reliefs depicting scenes from Egyptian mythology and everyday life. The best known tomb is that of Tutankhamun, who was buried there in 1922 following its discovery by Howard Carter.
