#  Woman Wins Lawsuit Against Sycuan Casino Astro Magic Game 

Elaine Sanchez became a millionaire overnight when she won a lawsuit against the Sycuan Casino in El Cajon, California. Sanchez filed the lawsuit in 2014, claiming that the casino’s Astro Magic game was rigged. A jury agreed, awarding her $6.8 million in damages. 

Sanchez is not the only person to have accused the casino of rigging its games. Other gamblers have made similar allegations, but none have been as successful as Sanchez in getting compensation from the casino. 

Sycuan Casino has denied any wrongdoing, and said that it will appeal the jury’s decision.

#  California Woman Awarded $10,000 in Lawsuit Against Sycuan Casino 

A California woman has been awarded $10,000 in a lawsuit against the Sycuan Casino. The woman, who is only identified as J.B., filed the suit in February of this year, claiming that the casino had negligently allowed her to be intoxicated to the point of incapacity.

J.B. reported that she had visited the casino on December 30th, 2016, and consumed multiple alcoholic beverages while there. By the time she left the casino at around 2am, she was so drunk that she was unable to walk or stand without assistance. She claims that casino staff failed to take any action to halt her intoxication or ensure her safety, instead allowing her to leave and stumble home alone.

The jury in the case found unanimously in favor of J.B., awarding her $10,000 in damages. In their ruling, they cited the responsibility that casinos have to prevent drunk patrons from harming themselves or others. This is not the first time that a casino has been sued for such an incident; in 2012 a man won a $750,000 judgment against Caesars Palace in Las Vegas after he fell and was injured while intoxicated.

While this verdict may set a precedent for similar cases in the future, it remains to be seen whether it will have any impact on how casinos deal with intoxicated guests. In light of this verdict, it is important for people who visit casinos to be aware of their rights and responsibilities when drinking alcohol there.

#  Woman Suing Casino Over Alleged Malfunction in Astro Magic Game 

A woman in Louisiana is suing a casino over what she alleges was a malfunction in an Astro Magic game that caused her to lose $200.

The plaintiff, whose name has not been released, filed the lawsuit earlier this month in the 19th Judicial District Court in East Baton Rouge Parish.

She is seeking damages in excess of $50,000 for the alleged loss, as well as court costs and interest.

According to the court filing, the plaintiff was playing Astro Magic at L’Auberge Casino & Hotel on Jan. 16 when something went wrong with the game.

She claims that the machine failed to properly credit her winnings, resulting in her losing $200.

A spokesperson for L’Auberge Casino told Louisiana publication The Advocate that they do not comment on pending litigation.

This isn’t the first time that someone has sued a casino over a game malfunction. In 2012, a man in Missouri won $7 million from a Blackjack game after his card was incorrectly dealt, while in 2013 a woman in California successfully sued a casino over a slot machine that allegedly failed to pay out properly.

#  Woman Sues Sycuan Casino for $1 Million After Losing in Astro Magic Game 

A woman is suing the Sycuan Casino in California for $1 million after losing what she claims was her life savings in an Astro Magic game. 64-year-old Doris Carver alleges that she was playing the game when a malfunction caused her to lose over $32,000 in just minutes.

Casino officials say that the machine was working properly and that Carver simply lost due to poor luck. They have countersued Carver, claiming that she acted negligently and failed to follow casino rules by not asking for help when she started losing money.

The case is scheduled to go to trial in November.

#  Woman Files Lawsuit Against Sycuan Casino Over Malfunctioning Astro Magic Game

A woman has filed a lawsuit against Sycuan Casino over its malfunctioning Astro Magic game. The woman, who is identified in court documents as Jane Doe, claims that she was playing the game on June 11 when it suddenly stopped working, causing her to lose over $1,000 in the process.

In her lawsuit, Doe alleges that Sycuan Casino was negligent in maintaining the game and that as a result, she suffered significant financial damages. She is seeking compensation for her losses as well as attorneys’ fees and other costs associated with the lawsuit.

This is not the first time that Sycuan Casino has been sued over its Astro Magic game. In fact, the casino has been hit with several lawsuits in recent years over alleged malfunctions with the game. In each case, the casino has denied any wrongdoing and has argued that any problems with the game were due to user error.

Whether or not Doe will be able to win her case against Sycuan Casino remains to be seen. However, if she is successful, it could mean big payouts for other players who have also suffered losses as a result of the game’s malfunctioning.
