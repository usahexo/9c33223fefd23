Looking to up your roulette game? You’ve come to the right place. Pure Casino is here to give you the inside scoop on how to win big every time you sit down at the roulette wheel. So, without further ado, let’s jump right in!

First things first – understand the basic rules of roulette. This will help you develop a winning strategy. Roulette is a game of chance played with a spinning wheel and a set of numbered slots.

The object of the game is to guess correctly and be awarded with money based on the odds for that particular bet.

There are a few different types of bets you can make in roulette: inside bets and outside bets. An inside bet is a bet placed on one of the six pockets located on the numbered grid on the betting table layout. An outside bet is a bet placed on one of the 18 coloured pockets located outside of this grid or one of the other two betting areas marked ‘evens’ or ‘odds’.

Now that you know the basics, it’s time to start betting like a pro! Here are our top tips for winning at roulette:

1) Start by making small bets until you feel comfortable with the game – this will help minimize your losses if you happen to lose early on.

2) Place your bets on even chances – these offer some of the best odds in the game and provide a good base for your strategy. Our favourites include red/black, high/low and odd/even bets.

3) Be patient and wait for clear opportunities before placing larger bets – this will increase your chances or winning big!

4) Mix up your bets to keep the casino guessing – this will make it more difficult for them to beat you.

5) Use Roulette Systems software – these handy tools can help you implement winning strategies and give you an edge over the casino.

European Roulette is a game that involves betting on the outcome of a spin of a wheel. The wheel has 37 numbers (1-36 and a 0), and players can bet on either individual numbers or combinations of numbers. The aim is to correctly predict which number (or combination of numbers) the ball will stop on after spinning around the edge of the wheel. If you guess correctly, you win!

What are the different types of bets that can be placed in European Roulette?

There are many different types of bets that can be placed in European Roulette, but some of the most common ones include: Single number – Betting on a specific number. This pays out at 35-1.


 Corner bet – Betting on four adjoining numbers at once. This pays out at 8-1.

 Five number bet – Betting on zero, double zero, one, two and three. This pays out at 6-1 only if zero comes up.

 Dozen bet – Betting on 12 consecutive numbers (1-12, 13-24 or 25-36). This pays out at 2-1.

 Column bet – Betting on one third of the table (from top to bottom). This pays out at 2-1. You can also make ‘outside’ bets which involve betting on things other than what number will come up on the wheel. These include betting on whether or not red or black will come up, whether there will be a even or odd number spun, or whether the number will be high (19-36) or low (1-18).

Which is better - American Roulette or European Roulette?

American Roulette has 38 slots including a double zero, while European Roulette has just 37 slots including a single zero. Because of this extra slot, American Roulette offers worse odds for players when compared to European Roulette - making European Roulette casinos much more popular amongst punters.

One of the best ways to improve your chances of winning when playing roulette is to use a roulette system. There are many different systems out there that you can use, so it is important to do your research to find the right one for you. The Martingale System is one of the most popular systems, and it involves doubling your bet after every loss in order to win back your losses and make a profit.

2. Know Your Odds

Another important thing to remember when playing roulette is to know your odds. This will help you to determine which bets are worth placing and which ones are not. Some bets offer better odds than others, so it is important to choose wisely.

3. Don’t Bet on Red or Black

When playing roulette, one of the biggest mistakes that players make is betting on red or black. These are two of the most common bets that players make, but they also offer very poor odds. In fact, the odds of winning on either of these bets are just 48%. Therefore, it is advisable not to bet on red or black if you want to increase your chances of winning.

4. Bet on Numbers Instead

Instead of betting on red or black, another option is to bet on individual numbers. This offers much better odds than betting on colors, as the odds of winning are around 94%. So, if you want a higher chance of winning money when playing roulette, then betting on numbers is the way to go.
