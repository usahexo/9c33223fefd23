#  Hand Calculator Crowned King of Online Poker Rooms!

Since the early 2000s, hand calculators have reigned as the undisputed kings of online poker rooms. These handy tools allow players to quickly and easily calculate the odds of winning any given hand, giving them a distinct advantage over their opponents.

But recent technological advances have finally begun to chip away at the hand calculator's dominance. Poker bots equipped with artificial intelligence can now not only calculate the odds of winning a hand, but also make decisions based on those odds. This has led to a surge in bot-owned tables at many online poker rooms, and poses a serious threat to the hand calculator's supremacy.

However, hand calculators are still more than capable of holding their own against even the most advanced poker bots. In fact, many top players rely on hand calculators to give them an edge over their opponents. So don't be surprised if you see one in use at your next online poker game!
