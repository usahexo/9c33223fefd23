#  Curie is the key to winning big on slot machines!

How many times have you gone to the casino, filled with intentions of winning big, but walked away empty-handed? If you're like most people, the answer is probably "a lot." However, what if there was a secret to casino success that you've been overlooking?

Believe it or not, that secret is Curie. Curie is a slot machine payout calculator that can help you increase your chances of winning big at the casino. By using Curie to determine the best time to bet and when to pull the lever, you can improve your odds of walking away a winner.

To get started with Curie, simply enter in the amount of money that you want to spend on a particular slot machine and the number of spins you plan to make. Curie will then calculate the expected value of each spin and tell you when it's best to bet and when it's best to pull the lever.

For example, let's say that you want to spend $10 on a slot machine and plan to make 100 spins. Curie will tell you that the expected value of each spin is $0.10 and that it's best to bet when the expected value is positive and pull the lever when it's negative. In this case, you should bet when the expected value is $0.20 or higher and pull the lever when it's below -$0.10.

Curie can also be used for other casino games such as blackjack and roulette. Simply enter in your betting parameters and Curie will do all of the hard work for you! So next time you hit up your favourite casino, be sure to bring along your copy of Curie for guaranteed success!
