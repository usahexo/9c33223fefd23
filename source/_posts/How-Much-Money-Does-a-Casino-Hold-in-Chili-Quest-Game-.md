Casino-goers seeking a fiery challenge and the chance to win big can now do both at the same time at Casino du Lac-Leamy. The casino is set to host a chili quest game with over $100,000 in prize money up for grabs.

Participants in the chili quest will compete to create the spiciest dish possible, with the winner taking home a cool $10,000. There are also prizes of $5,000 and $2,500 on offer for second and third place, respectively.

Although it may be tempting to simply dump a load of hot sauce into your dish, Casino du Lac-Leamy is warning contestants against taking this approach. Contestants must create dishes that contain real chili peppers in order to be eligible for judging.

In addition to the main prize, there are also several smaller prizes on offer for runners-up. These include a weekend for two at the casino, a $1,000 shopping spree at Canadian Tire and a year’s supply of hot sauce from specialty store Chili Pepper Pete’s.

The chili quest game is open to all participants aged 18 or over. Registration is now open and will run until October 13th. Contestants must submit their entries at the casino’s front desk no later than 5pm on the day of the contest.

This isn’t the first time that Casino du Lac-Leamy has hosted a chili quest competition – in fact, it’s now in its fifth year. And if past years are anything to go by, then we can expect some pretty spicy entries indeed!
