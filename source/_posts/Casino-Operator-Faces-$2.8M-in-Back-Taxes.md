#  Casino Operator Faces $2.8M in Back Taxes

A New Jersey casino operator is facing a $2.8 million tax bill from the state. The company, which operates two casinos in the state, failed to pay taxes on its slot machines and table games for a two-year period.

The casino operator says it is working to pay back the money, but didn’t say how it would cover the debt. In a statement, the company said it was “disappointed with the decision by the state of New Jersey” and that it has been in “constructive conversations” with state officials.

This is not the first time the company has had issues with taxes. In 2017, the company agreed to pay $5 million to settle a dispute with the state over unpaid taxes.

Tax disputes are common among casinos, as they are often able to deduct expenses like marketing and employee salaries from their taxable income. This can leave them with little taxable profit and lead to disagreements with tax authorities over how much should be paid.

#  Gambling Site Owner Fined for Tax Evasion

The owner of a gambling website has been fined for tax evasion.

The owner, who is based in the United States, failed to declare over $1 million in profits from his website.

He has been fined $100,000 and ordered to pay back taxes of $380,000.

In addition, he has been banned from operating a gambling site for five years.

This is not the first time that the owner has been caught evading taxes. In 2009, he was fined for failing to disclose over $2 million in income.

#  Casino Fails to Pay Out $1M in Slot Machine Winnings

A casino in upstate New York has failed to pay out $1M in slot machine winnings to a local man, prompting a lawsuit.

According to the plaintiff, he hit the jackpot on a slot machine at the casino in late 2017 and was told by casino personnel that he would be paid out soon. However, several months later and after numerous attempts to collect his winnings, the casino still has not paid him.

As a result, the plaintiff has filed a lawsuit against the casino seeking the $1M in winnings plus interest and attorney's fees.

This is not the first time that a casino has been accused of failing to payout slot machine winnings. In fact, there have been several high-profile cases in recent years of casinos refusing to pay out large jackpots.

In one such case, a man won nearly $43M on a slot machine but the casino refused to pay him, arguing that the machine had malfunctioned. The man eventually won his case in court and was awarded the money, but it took several years and cost him millions of dollars in legal fees.

So why do casinos sometimes fail to pay out slot machine winnings?

There are several possible reasons. One possibility is that the casino is struggling financially and cannot afford to payout large jackpots. Another possibility is that the casino is using "fine print" to avoid paying out large sums of money. For example, casinos may argue that a winning player must meet certain conditions (such as gambling for a certain amount of time) in order to be eligible for a payout.

Whatever the reason, it is clear that casinos can occasionally fail to payout slot machine winnings, causing significant financial hardship for players. If you are lucky enough to hit the jackpot on a slot machine, make sure you know what your rights are and how to go about collecting your winnings.

#  Taxman Comes Calling on Online Gambling Firm


The British government is coming down hard on an online gambling firm, ordering it to pay millions of pounds in back taxes.

The taxman says the company--which has not been named publicly--owes £5.5 million in unpaid taxes from 2006 to 2014. The company has reportedly disputed the claim.

A spokesman for the HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) said: "We can confirm that we have served a notice on an online gambling company requiring payment of £5.5 million in back taxes owed from 2006 to 2014. This follows an extensive compliance investigation by HMRC."

It's not clear why the HMRC waited so long to come after the gambling firm, but it's likely the government is trying to make an example out of the company in order to deter other businesses from cheating on their taxes.

This is just the latest crackdown by the British government on tax evasion. In recent years, HMRC has stepped up its efforts to go after companies that shirk their obligations, and has recovered billions of pounds in unpaid taxes.

#  Is Your Gambling Winnings Taxable?

The answer to this question is not as straightforward as one might think. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has a complex set of rules governing when gambling income is taxable and when it is not.

Generally, gambling income is taxable if it is “ordinary and necessary” in carrying out your trade or business. This encompasses most types of gambling winnings, including casino games, lotteries, horse races, and poker tournaments. However, there are a few exceptions. For instance, gambling losses are generally not deductible.

There are also a number of special rules that apply to certain types of gambling income. Gambling winnings from betting or wagering on horses are subject to a flat 25% tax rate. Winnings from bingo, keno, and slot machines are subject to a flat 28% tax rate. And gambling winnings from lotteries are subject to a graduated tax rate that maxes out at 39%.

In order to determine whether your gambling winnings are taxable, you first need to calculate your “gross income” from gambling. This is the total amount you won minus the total amount you lost. If your gross income from gambling is negative (you lost more than you won), then you do not have to report any of your gambling income on your tax return. However, if your gross income from gambling is positive, then you must report all of the income on your return.

You can claim a deduction for your losses up to the amount of your taxable gambling income. In other words, you cannot use your losses to offset other types of income on your tax return.

The bottom line is that if you have taxable gambling income, you must report it on your tax return. There are a number of special rules that apply, so it is important to consult with a qualified tax professional in order to determine how these rules affect you specifically.
